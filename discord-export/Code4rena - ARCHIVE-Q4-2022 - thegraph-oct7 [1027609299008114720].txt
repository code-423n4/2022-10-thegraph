will the KYC needed for every contest from now on or is it only for this one ?

l think it's only for this particular contest, as you can see the blur contest doesn't have the KYC rule

no l think u misunderstood this isn't the line of code that needs to be audited in the contract. 😅  SLOC is the "Source lines of code" which the contract holds.

This should be a private or an invite-only contest as per Code4rena docs:
https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/certified-contributors
Weird that it's allowed to submit findings before getting certified and passing OFAC checks. We're risking not getting paid at all since certification might take a long time or a warden might not have the papers required by Provenance.
There will be many complains from people who submitted findings but haven't certified.

https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/certified-contributors
Certified contributors
In order to create opportunities for contributions which rely on establishment of trust, Code4rena allows community members to opt into certifying their identity and entering into a simple agreement.


[10/08/2022 12:39] pfapostol
This information is written on the contest page, if people have submitted a report without even reading it, it's strange. But in general it would be better if the contest was private

@abarmat or any other sponsor. I am trying to run the test with gas report. But I get the following series of errors:
`curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8545 after 1 ms: Connection refused`

and there is no gas report. even after all the 545 tests have passed.


[10/08/2022 14:51] pcarranzav
Hi @ElKu  That error is expected as the script checks if the local node is up - eventually it will succeed. Are you checking the reports folder? It won’t output the report to the terminal


[10/08/2022 14:54] elku.cryptos
@pcarranzav oh thanks. was looking at the terminal. yes. its in the reports folder. Do you know why this file looks weird? Not sure if its because I am in windows?

[10/08/2022 15:05] pcarranzav
Yeah it has the escape sequences to format in the terminal. My suggestion would be to `cat reports/gas-report.log` in a terminal.
I’m not sure if the windows cmd line will format it correctly, but if not you can try in the Windows Subsystem for Linux maybe?


[10/08/2022 15:10] pcarranzav
Unless you’re already using WSL? Not sure how you would’ve managed to run the bash script for the test otherwise… sorry I haven’t used Windows in ages 😅


[10/08/2022 15:15] elku.cryptos
hey thx a lot. I am already using WSL. the `cat reports/gas-report.log` command works fine. so no issues. I was opening the report in VSCode and it was showing the `esc` char.


[10/08/2022 15:16] pcarranzav
Good to hear! I’ll make a note to make the test:gas script cat the file at the end, should make it easier to use

[10/08/2022 18:13] pedrod89
hey @zzykxx @pfapostol 

**On KYC:** 
This contest must follow The Graph Foundation's current AML policy, which mandates a KYC process for those receiving any type of funds paid by us. We are actively rethinking the current policy to become less strict, but that's how things are atm. 

Rest assured, we won't have access to your private information - we just required Code4rena to ensure us wardens go through their KYC (which in turn, is done with an external service provider).


[10/08/2022 18:25] pfapostol
KYC is very restrictive of countries under US sanctions, which is not very logical since Ethereum transactions are anonymous (in a way).


[10/08/2022 18:40] pedrod89
I do understand the frustration. Like I said, we're working on making it less strict. 
Hope you can still participate!


[10/08/2022 19:08] codecipher9
will KYC be obligatory in all the future contests or it's exceptionally for this one ?


[10/08/2022 19:53] pcarranzav
I assume until the policy changes, as Pedro mentioned, any contests sponsored by The Graph would also need KYC. But this doesn't apply to contests from other sponsors (unless they too require KYC I suppose).

[10/10/2022 05:31] pcarranzav
👋 you can DM me @kamensec


[10/10/2022 09:19] 0xmatt#3768
3. If it being publicly known you work in this space could affect your safety (and before you say nobody will know can I draw your attention to Celsius' disclosure documents that publicly identify KYC'd customers)
4. If you understand that the entire reason for cryptocurrency existing is pseudonymous, censorship resistant, peer-to-peer value transfer and that shoehorning in KYC means the whole space would be better off just using centralized servers with PHP and MySQL for their apps.
5. If your disappointment comes from allowing people to do the work and submit findings but then not getting paid for them, instead of knowing which users are and aren't KYC and stopping submissions for non-KYC'd people.

But if someone's happy doing KYC then great for them. And if you're not it's a personal choice and there's no benefit yucking other peoples yum.

Privacy, if there's no need for some kind of information to provide a service then I don't want to give that information.

I just bumped now on this project, quite surprised with the "important note", this is the first time i encounter  like this in code4rena. This might become a trend ouch.😢 . Hopefully not. Privacy is really important matter.


[10/11/2022 01:55] 100proof
If it makes any difference, and it might not, C4 has a really interesting way of doing KYC where C4 never actually learns your identity but a third-party (called Provenance) knows who both parties are.


[10/11/2022 10:32] minh___
it has been done before with the open sea contest


[10/11/2022 13:15] tmigone
Can you clarify which deposit and withdraw you mean?


[10/11/2022 13:40] ladboy233

hi, are the contracts for the l1 and l2 routers available to peruse ?


[10/11/2022 23:27] tmigone
The code is available here:
- https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway
- https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway

Deployed contracts can be found here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses

However I need to point out these contracts are not part of the scope for this contest.

[10/12/2022 12:44] pcarranzav
these are **not** in scope, and still WIP, but in case the examples are useful:
- This PR would add some L1/L2 bridging with callhooks to the billing flow: https://github.com/edgeandnode/billing-contracts/pull/22/files#diff-f9ba9dbb22b0567347fbb9255e10a2843f328f35e2ee3dd37f8b616c2dd034d8R166-R175 
- This PR would be used to migrate subgraphs from L1 to L2. It won't look right, because I still haven't wrapped the receiveSubgraphFromL1 function inside an onTokenTransfer function: https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/pull/585/files#diff-00d72711833706736d9e64439acf574cf449c8ef042f78d400b7f46da7762b17R66-R94
